        In my opinion, One piece is <del>one of the best</del> <ins>the best manga</ins> and anime ever written. The story is full of diferent references about many cultures, movies and series. Eichiro Oda, the creator of the manga, used to expend a lot of time as kid reading books and watching movies that served as inspiration for his work.

        Some people might argue that the manga is too long since it has more than 1100 chapters. Nonetheless, it is a story that you conenect with from the first chapters. In addition, as the <acronym title="Greatest Of All Time">GOAT</acronym> Eiichiro Oda said <cite>The part that im most excited to do is the Final Saga</cite>.
