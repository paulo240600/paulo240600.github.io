    <p>
      As we all know, Machu Picchu is on of the seven wonders of the modern world. It is located in Peru, in the city of Cuzco. The reason why I want to visit this tourist place is because I am Peruvian and I have lived more than 24 years in Peru but I never had the opportunity to visit this majestic place. Other reason why I want to visit this place is to see the twelve angle stone in one of the walls of Machu Picchu.
