                    One of my biggest dreams since I started reading mangas was visiting Japan because I am really intrigued by their traditions, culture and all the different places that you can visit. Aditionaly, I would like to see all those big cities full of lights like Tokio or Hiroshima.

                    One piece is my favorite manga, I really enjoy the development of the piece and the enormous number of characters. Aditionaly, I love tattoos, I have 14 and and 5 of those are related to One Piece characters. I am planning to get number 6 and it would be the ship of the strawhats.

                    When I turn 16 years old I found out soccer was not the only sport out there. I was in the US eating McDonals and I watched the TV. Cavaliers vs Warriors 2016 NBA Finals Game 7, from that moment on I dream on going to a NBA game and that dream may come true soon.

                    I really like comedy shows, specially stand up monologues. It all started with Kevin Heart and all the specials he has in Netflix and after that I looked for other comedians and their content. I do not know when but I would like to learn about comedy and how to write monologues.

                    When I was 12 years my cousin was playing guitar flash and Psychosocial from Slipknot was playing. Right away the song caught my attention. Couple of years after, the band came to Peru i was able to watch them perform, I hope that was not the last time.

                    I have been using the same phone for the last 5 or 6 years. I believe it is time to change for a new and better one. Specially if you considerer that the rear glass is completely broken, you can even see the hardware inside of it. I am expecting to change this year but you never know.
