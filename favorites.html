        This page has been specialy created to mention the best games, movies, and songs ever for the author. It is a personal tier list that should not be taken as an absolute. At the end of the day we all get to choose  our favorites.

        The reason why I picked these games is because they been part of my life for a while, specialy when I was a kid and even now. For the movies, I picked that ones that impact me the most base on the history, the actors and the hype. Last but not least, the songs were picked base on the how they make me feel and what kind of energy they bring.
